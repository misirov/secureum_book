### Structs & Enums

#### Structs

From a data structure perspective, structs are custom data structures that can group together several variables of the same or different types to create something very unique to the contract as required by the developer. The various members of the structs are accessed as follows

```solidity
// Create a struct
struct Book { 
   string title;
   string author;
   uint book_id;
}
// Fill in some info
Book my_book = Book("El Quixote", "Miguel de Cervantes", 1);
// Access a member
my_book.author
```

which returns...

```solidity
"Miguel de Cervantes"
```

A struct is an aggregate type that is commonly used within `Solidity` to pack together custom data structures.

#### Enums

Enums are another user defined custom type in `Solidity`. They can be used to represent a finite set of constant integer values as represented by the members of the enum. Every enum needs to have a minimum of one member and can have a maximum of 256 members. As they represent the underlying integer values, they can be explicitly converted to and from integers. An example looks as follows

```solidity
enum ActionChoices{GoLeft, GoRight};
ActionChoices choice = ActionChoices.GoRight;
```

So here `choice` is a variable of `ActionChoices` and it can be assigned the members of `ActionChoices`. Here we are assigning `ActionChoices.GoRight` to `choice` and during the course of the contact function, different members can be assigned to that variable and it can be read from. This is used to improve readability, so instead of using integer values one can use specific names that correspond to those integer values in the context of what makes sense from that contract and its underlying logic.
