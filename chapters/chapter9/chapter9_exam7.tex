\section{Audit Findings 101 Quiz}

All questions in this quiz are based on the \verb|InSecureumDAO| contract snippet.
This is the same contract snippet you will see for all the 8 questions in this quiz.
The \verb|InSecureumDAO| contract snippet illustrates some basic functionality of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) which includes the opening of the DAO for memberships, allowing users to join as members by depositing a membership fee, creating proposals for voting, casting votes, etc\dots
Assume that all the other functionality (that is not shown or represented by ``\verb|...|'') is implemented correctly.

\textbf{1. Based on the comments and code shown in the \texttt{InSecureumDAO} snippet}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item The DAO is meant to be opened only by the \verb|admin| by making an Ether deposit to the contract.
    \item DAO can be opened by anyone by making an Ether deposit to the contract.
    \item DAO requires an exact payment of \verb|membershipFee| to join the DAO.
    \item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{2. Based on the comments and code shown in the \texttt{InSecureumDAO} snippet}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Guarded launch via circuit breakers has been implemented correctly for all state modifying functions.
    \item Zero-address check(s) has/have been implemented correctly.
    \item All critical privileged-role functions have events emitted.
    \item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{3. Reentrancy protection only on \texttt{join()} (assume it's correctly specified) indicates that}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Only \verb|payable| functions require this protection because of handling \verb|msg.value|.
    \item\verb|join()| likely makes untrusted external call(s) but not the other contract functions.
    \item Both A and B.
    \item Neither A nor B.
\end{enumerate}

Find the solution \hyperref[sec:exam7_q3]{here}.\\

\textbf{4. Access control on \texttt{msg.sender} for DAO membership is required in}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \verb|createVote()| to prevent non-members from creating votes.
    \item \verb|castVote()| to prevent non-members from casting votes.
    \item \verb|getWinningOutcome()| to prevent non-members from viewing winning outcomes.
    \item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

Find the solution \hyperref[sec:exam7_q4]{here}.\\

\textbf{5. A commit/reveal scheme (a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later) is relevant for}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \verb|join()| to not disclose \verb|msg.sender| while joining the DAO.
    \item \verb|createVote()| to not disclose the possible outcomes during creation.
    \item \verb|castVote()| to not disclose the vote being cast.
    \item All the above.
\end{enumerate}

Find the solution \hyperref[sec:exam7_q5]{here}.\\

\textbf{6. Security concern(s) from missing input validation(s) is/are present in}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \verb|createVote()| for duplicate \verb|_voteId|.
    \item \verb|castVote()| for existing \verb|_voteId|.
    \item \verb|getWinningOutcome()| for existing \verb|_voteId|.
    \item \verb|setMembershipFee()| for sanity/threshold checks on \verb|_fee|.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{7. \texttt{removeAllMembers()} function}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Will not work as expected to remove all the members from the DAO.
    \item Will work as expected to remove all the members from the DAO.
    \item Is a critical function missing an event emission.
    \item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

Find the solution \hyperref[sec:exam7_q7]{here}.\\

\textbf{8. \texttt{InSecureumDAO} will \textit{not} be susceptible to something like the 2016 ``DAO exploit''}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Because it derives from \verb|ReentrancyGuard.sol| which protects all contract functions by default.
    \item Only if it does not have a withdraw Ether function vulnerable to reentrancy and makes no external calls.
    \item Because Ethereum protocol was fixed after the DAO exploit to prevent such exploits.
    \item Because Solidity language was fixed after the DAO exploit to prevent such exploits.
